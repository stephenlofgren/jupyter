# Jupyter

<p>I love Jupyter Notebook for the ability to document and execute code as a learning and teaching tool.  I started this repo for exactly that, learning and teaching</p>  

## Project Euler
<p>I wanted to find some programming challenges that I could complete to build, validate, and demonstrate skill.  I came across http://projecteuler.net which should give me years of challenging exercise.</p>

## Installation
<p>After downloading the source code create a virtualenv and use pip to install the requirements.txt</p>
